<h2>PHYSICAL BENEFITS</h2>
<div class="grid">
    <div class="box a">BUTTERFLY:</div>
	<div class="box b"> In butterfly, you primarily use your chest and your mid-back (below the shoulder blades). When you pull, the biceps (top of the arm) are activated and you begin to use your triceps to extend your arms. Your shoulders start to move your arms out of the water, extending them explosively and using your abs, upper back, and lower back to pull them out. Once your arms, hit the water, the process begins again.</div>
	<div class="box c"> During the kick of butterfly, you're doing what is referred to is as a "dolphin kick". You use your stomach and hips to begin a smooth motion to match the pattern of your pull. You use both of your legs to kick with your calves and thighs. </div>

<div class="grid">
	<div class="box e">BACKSTROKE:</div>
	<div class="box f">In backstroke, you use your upper and mid-shoulders. The stroke begins with your arm exiting the water, while your shoulder is moving in a circle motion to rotate the arm. Once the arm hits the water, the other arm exits the water and the same arm continues to hit the water right next to the head, where you're arm pulls through the water, bending at the elbow. Here, you're working the lower back and biceps. </div>
	<div class="box g">The kick in backstroke is the same as freestyle, backwards. During the whole pull, you continue one kick, which is moving each leg up and down so that your feet are entering and exiting the water, causing a big splash each time.</div>
	</div>

	</div>
<div class="grid">
	<div class="box i">BREASTSTROKE:</div>
	<div class="box j">In breaststroke, you begin with a pull, as many kids learned as "cutting the pizza". You bend your forearms, which are being worked as well as your tricep as you pull your forearms back together in a circular motion. Here you're using your chest (below the neck), your upper arms/back and mid-back.</div>
	<div class="box k"> The kick of breaststroke is the most important part. The kick does most of the work, where you open your legs, using your calves to kick them back together, while your arms are pulling. The kick works the calves and shins very hard. </div>
	</div>

	</div>
<div class="grid">
	<div class="box m">FREESTYLE:</div>
	<div class="box n">Freestyle works a lot of the arm and upper back. Beginning with the pull, where your arm pulls through the water, bending at the elbow (very similar to backstroke), and your biceps working with your forearms. Your shoulders are being worked here, rotating your arms so that your shoulder is out of the water. When you breath, you work your neck as you turn it to the side. The other arm begins to pull as the first arm is exiting the water.</div>
	<div class="box o">Freestlye kick is the same kick as backstroke, this time your legs facing down. You use your thighs to lift your feet and calves up and down.</div>
